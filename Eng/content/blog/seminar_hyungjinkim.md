#### Abstract

The APEC Climate Center (APCC) is a leading climate information service provider and research institute that serves the 21 APEC member economies as well as the broader international community. The vision of APCC is to contribute to economic growth in the APEC region and support the protection of lives and property, the reduction of economic losses, and enhance economic opportunities.
In order to accomplish such vision, APCC produces and provides value-added, reliable, and timely climate prediction to countries in the APEC region, while serving as a key climate information center to distribute climate data, prediction, and related tools. APCC also leads in developing and applying interdisciplinary application techniques, combining climate and other related sectors to serve the social needs and respond to climate change in specific countries and regions. In addition, APCC assists developing economies from the APEC region and beyond in building their capacities to produce reliable climate prediction and to maintain and utilize APCC products created through our climate information application research.
In this seminar, I would like to first demonstrate the use of seamless prediction and the development an early warning system by which the provision of preemptive information is made available. Second, I also would like to introduce interdisciplinary research of how agricultural productivity can benefit from climate data and enhanced agrometeorological services.
