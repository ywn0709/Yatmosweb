#### Abstract

The development and availability of high-power ultrashort pulse lasers have attracted many interesting applications such as weather control, lightening guiding, LIDAR, ion-tumor therapy, proton radiography, and fast ignition for inertial confined fusion. As ultrafast lasers propagate through a medium, a highly complex and dynamic physical phenomenon caused by nonlinear interaction between the intense optical field and the propagating medium generates a plasma channel called laser filament. This laser filament has special characteristics such as self-focusing, self-phase modulation and self-healing effect. These properties allow the laser filament to maintain its dimensions for long distances (much longer than the Rayleigh length of an equivalent Gaussian beam), generate broader spectrum, and propagate kilometric distances. This long distance propagation of high intense laser beam allows us to explore remote sensing of explosives/chemical weapons, weather control, lightening guiding and even microwave guiding.
In addition to the ultrashort pulse lasers, a recent development of ultra-intense ultrashort pulse lasers up to 4 PW peak power allowed fundamental researches such as direct laser ion acceleration in a relativistic regime. This direct laser proton/ion/electron acceleration opens up various applications of compact ultrashort electron/proton beams and radiations sources for gamma-ray spectroscopy, remote nondestructive inspection, ultrafast bio/nano imaging technology, high-energy particle colliders, proton therapy and radiography.
The presentation will cover from the basic concept of laser filament to laser matter interaction in the relativistic regimes and the transition from science fictions to real applications.
